This is the initial content of chapter 7, paragraph 3. Continue now ! and then ? Then just continue it ;-). Who is the comitter ? Who is the author ? Is it always the owner ? Commiter might not be the author ... And vice-versa !
Multiline works obviously !
For sure !
Definitely :D And now ? I don't know. I don't know neither ! So what's next ? Next is maybe to push something ! But you need to pull before wright ? Or maybe fetch only ?Acutally it seems that I just have to accept the invite, to fill in my github credentials, and follow the indications...:)
